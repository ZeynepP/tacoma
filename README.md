TemporAl COntact Modeling and Analysis. Provides fast tools to analyze temporal contact networks, 
produce surrogate networks using qualitative models and simulate Gillespie processes on them.

## Quick example

In order to download the SocioPatterns 
['Hypertext 2009'-dataset](http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/hypertext-2009-dynamic-contact-network/) 
and visualize it interactively, do the following.

```python
>>> import tacoma as tc
>>> from tacoma.interactive import visualize
>>> temporal_network = tc.download_and_convert_sociopatterns_hypertext_2009()
100% [..............................................................................] 67463 / 67463
>>> visualize(temporal_network, frame_dt = 20)
```

## What is tacoma?

`tacoma` is a joint C++/Python-package for the modeling and analysis of undirected and 
unweighted temporal networks, with a focus on (but not limited to) human face-to-face contact networks.

### Pros of using tacoma

* networks are natively described in continuous time (which includes descriptions in discrete time
* two main native formats to describe temporal networks (`tc.edge_lists` and `tc.edge_changes`),
  a third way, a sorted list of `on`-intervals for each edge called `tc.edge_trajectories` is
  available, but algorithms work on the two native formats only
* the simple portable file-format `.taco` as a standardized way to share temporal network data
  (which is just the data dumped to a `.json`-file, a simple file format readable from a
  variety of languages)
* easy functions to produce surrogate temporal networks from four different models
* easy way to simulate Gillespie (here, epidemic spreading) processes on temporal networks
  with an implementation of [Vestergaard's and GÃ©nois's adapted algortihm](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004579)
* easy framework to develop new Gillespie-simulations algorithms on temporal networks
* multiple and simple ways to interactively visualize temporal networks
* simple functions to manipulate temporal networks (slice, concatenate, rescale time, sample, bin, convert)
* simple functions to analyze structural and statistical properties of temporal networks
  (mean degree, degree distribution, group size distribution, group life time distributions, etc.)
* fast algorithms due to C++-core (_fast_ as in _faster than pure Python_)
* relatively fast and easy to compile since it only depends on the C++11-stdlib 
  and [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) without the large overhead of `Boost`

### Cons of using tacoma

* no support for directed temporal networks yet
* no support for weighted temporal networks yet

## Install

If you get compiling errors, make sure that [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) is installed.

    $ git clone https://github.com/benmaier/tacoma
    $ pip install ./tacoma

Note that a C++11-compiler has to be installed on the system before installing `tacoma`. On OS X
it might happen that even though pip installed `pybind11` it's not available during installation.
If that happens please open a detailed issue here. You might want to try 
    
    $ brew install pybind11

as a work-around.

### Packages not automatically installed during installation

The following packages are not installed during installation with `pip` since they're only required
for drawing and drawing is not essential. If you want to use `tacoma.drawing`, please install

    matplotlib
    networkx
    python-louvain (community)

## Documentation

The documentation is currently available at http://rocs.hu-berlin.de/~tacoma. It is full of
typos and non-exhaustive but I think the important points are in there.


## Examples

Check out the [sandbox directory](https://github.com/benmaier/tacoma/tree/master/sandbox]).

Here is an example for the temporal network format `tc.edge_changes`.

```python
import tacoma as tc
from tacoma.interactive import visualize

# define temporal network as a list of edge changes
temporal_network = tc.edge_changes()
temporal_network.N = 10
temporal_network.edges_initial = [ (0,1), (2,3), (1,7), (3,5), (1,9), (7,2) ]
temporal_network.t0 = 0.0
temporal_network.t = [ 0.8, 2.4 ]
temporal_network.tmax = 3.1
temporal_network.edges_in = [ 
                              [ (0, 5), (3, 6) ], 
                              [ (3, 7), (4, 9), (7, 8) ],
                            ]
temporal_network.edges_out = [ 
                                [ (0, 1) ],
                                [ (2, 3), (3, 6) ],
                             ]

visualize(temporal_network, frame_dt = 0.05)
```
