Dynamic Gillespie SSA
=====================

Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm is a powerful tool with a successful history
for the simulation of reaction processes in homogeneous media and static networks.
In the following we explain `Vestergaard's and Génois's adaption for temporal networks`_.

How it works
------------

.. The adpated Gillespie algorithm is a neat modular algorithm
.. in a sense that it solely depends on rates
.. and how they change when the network structure changes. This implies
.. that in an implementation we
